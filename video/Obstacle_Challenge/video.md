 - ### Explanation to Obstacle Challenge

    - The mission race is based on the qualification race with the addition of the obstacle avoidance task. The mission requirements are as follows:  
        - If the obstacle ahead is a red block, the robot needs to pass it on the left side.  
        - If the obstacle ahead is a green block, the robot needs to pass it on the right side.  
        - The robot must not push the blocks out of the designated circle.  
        - Additionally, if the last block in the second lap is red, the robot should reverse its direction in the third lap. If the last block is green, the direction remains unchanged.
