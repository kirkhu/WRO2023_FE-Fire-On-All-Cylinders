 - ### Explanation to Obstacle Challenge

    - The mission race is based on the qualification race with the addition of the obstacle avoidance task. The mission requirements are as follows:  
        - If the obstacle ahead is a red block, the robot needs to pass it on the left side.  
        - If the obstacle ahead is a green block, the robot needs to pass it on the right side.  
        - The robot must not push the blocks out of the designated circle.  
        - Additionally, if the last block in the second lap is red, the robot should reverse its direction in the third lap. If the last block is green, the direction remains unchanged.

    - 任務賽是基於資格賽再加上閃避積木任務，任務需求是:  
        - 若前方是紅色積木，需要從積木左邊通過  
        - 若前方是綠色積木，需要從積木右邊通過  
        - 不可將積木撞出圓圈外  
        - 另外，在第二圈的最後一個積木若為紅色，則第三圈需要反向行駛，若為綠色，則方向不變
