 - ### Explanation to Obstacle Challenge(任務賽講解) 

    - The Mission Challenge is based on the Qualifying Round with the addition of an obstacle avoidance task involving blocks. The mission requirements are as follows:
        If there is a red block ahead, the vehicle must pass to the left of the block.
        If there is a green block ahead, the vehicle must pass to the right of the block.
        It is not allowed to push the blocks out of the designated circle.
        If the last block in the second lap is red, the vehicle must reverse its direction in the third lap. If it is green, the direction remains unchanged.

    - 任務賽是基於資格賽再加上閃避積木任務，任務需求是:
        若前方是紅色積木，需要從積木左邊通過
        若前方是綠色積木，需要從積木右邊通過
        不可將積木撞出圓圈外
        在第二圈的最後一個積木若為紅色，則第三圈需要反向行駛，若為綠色，則方向不變
