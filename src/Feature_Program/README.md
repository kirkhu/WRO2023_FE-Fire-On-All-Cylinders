## <div align="center">Distinctive Pseudo Code</div>
__In our program, many repetitive sections of code have been written as subroutines to facilitate debugging and simplify program complexity. And perhaps the most distinctive feature in the program is the avoidance of code blocks resembling building blocks. Here is the excerpt of the program content.__
- ### Avoid obstacles until the field line is detected
  - This segment of the code will continuously detect if a line is detected. If detected, it will exit and perform a turn.
    ```

    ```   
- ### Translation in English: Avoid obstacles until the time is up
  - Since the camera cannot detect obstacles on the sides, turning back directly to the center of the road could lead to a collision with the obstacle. Therefore, it is necessary to continue moving forward for a certain duration until the obstacle is completely avoided.
    ```

    ```
- ### Detect if a turnaround is required and execute it
  - In the second round of the mission, if the color of the last obstacle is red, the third round requires reversing direction, while if it is green, the vehicle continues in the same direction.
    ```

    ```
