- ## Ackermann_steering_geometry
__Introduction to Ackermann_steering_geometry__
- The steering mechanism of the vehicles used in this competition is designed based on the Ackermann steering mechanism and implemented using LEGO parts. However, due to the fixed specifications of LEGO parts, modifications are not possible, and the design can only closely resemble the Ackermann steering mechanism.

- ##  Gear Differential
- Using commonly available LEGO differential gear parts with part numbers 65414, 65413, and 6589, as shown in the diagram, to simplify vehicle design and enhance maneuverability.

- ##  MacPher Suspension Systen
- We have selected this system as our suspension choice due to its advantages over the Double Wishbone Suspension System. The McPherson suspension system offers structural simplicity, ease of manufacturing, and space efficiency. Furthermore, the McPherson suspension system is extensively employed in modern vehicles, especially for front-wheel suspension. 

The main components of the system include:

Spring: Typically a combination of springs and shock absorbers, connecting the wheels and the body of the vehicle, absorbing vibrations and impacts from uneven road surfaces.

Upper Arm: Positioned above the vehicle's wheels, connecting the body and the wheels. Its design allows the wheels to move freely in the vertical direction.

Lower Arm: Connecting the vehicle's body and the wheels, assisting in controlling the motion of the wheels.
