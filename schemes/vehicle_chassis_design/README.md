- ## Ackermann_steering_geometry
__Introduction to Ackermann_steering_geometry__
- The steering mechanism of the vehicles used in this competition is designed based on the Ackermann steering mechanism and implemented using LEGO parts. However, due to the fixed specifications of LEGO parts, modifications are not possible, and the design can only closely resemble the Ackermann steering mechanism.

- ##  Gear Differential (齒輪差速器)
- ### Introduce Lego Differential 介紹樂高差速器
- This differential integrates a 16-tooth gear and a 24-tooth gear, both of which have a circular hole with a 5mm diameter at their centers for accommodating a cross-axis. In the center of the differential, there is a small pillar, which allows us to better secure the right-angle mating gear.

- 此差速器整合16尺齒輪和24尺齒輪，兩個齒輪中心有直徑5mm的圓孔，方便放置十字軸，差速器中央有一根小柱子，這可以讓我們更好的固定直角轉接齒輪

- ### 選擇原因
- Due to the compact size of this differential, and the fact that the larger 24-tooth gear on the motor is of the same size, it effectively transfers the motor's speed and torque to the tires without causing issues such as reducing torque due to a lower gear ratio or slowing down speed due to a higher gear ratio.

- 由於此差速器的尺寸不大，而且較大的齒輪和馬達上的24尺齒輪一樣大，這可以很好的將馬達的速度和扭力傳輸到輪胎上，不會造成加速比減少扭力或是減速比放慢速度的問題



- ##  MacPher Suspension Systen
- We have selected this system as our suspension choice due to its advantages over the Double Wishbone Suspension System. The McPherson suspension system offers structural simplicity, ease of manufacturing, and space efficiency. Furthermore, the McPherson suspension system is extensively employed in modern vehicles, especially for front-wheel suspension. 

    The main components of the system include:

    Spring: Typically a combination of springs and shock absorbers, connecting the wheels and the body of the vehicle, absorbing vibrations and impacts from uneven road surfaces.

    Upper Arm: Positioned above the vehicle's wheels, connecting the body and the wheels. Its design allows the wheels to move freely in the vertical direction.

    Lower Arm: Connecting the vehicle's body and the wheels, assisting in controlling the motion of the wheels.

- We have designed the following two options. The first option, due to its larger vertical vibration space, cannot effectively restrict the vehicle's vibrations. Therefore, we have chosen the second option, which has a smaller vibration amplitude and can also maintain the vehicle's low center of gravity.
