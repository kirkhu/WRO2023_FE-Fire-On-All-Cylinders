- ### Li-Polymer Battery: Hazards, Maintenance, and Composition
    - Hazards
        - Flammable
        - Contains toxic substances
        - Improper handling may lead to electronic device damage or combustion
    - Maintenance
        - Avoid charging in direct sunlight or high-temperature environments.
        - Keep away from flammable materials in the vicinity.
        - Remember to unplug the charging power source after completing the charging process to avoid overcharging.
        - Do not excessively discharge during use to prevent reducing battery lifespan.
        - Strictly prohibit tapping, dropping, or impacting the battery.
    - Composition
        - Polymer Electrolyte: Lithium polymer batteries use a polymer as the electrolyte, replacing the organic solvent electrolyte found in traditional lithium-ion batteries. This polymer electrolyte exhibits high ionic conductivity and chemical stability, effectively facilitating lithium-ion conduction and preventing internal short-circuits within the battery.  
        - Polymer Thin Film Separator: Lithium polymer batteries typically utilize a polymer thin film as the separator, which separates the anode and cathode to prevent direct contact.  
        - Anode: The anode is usually made of carbon materials such as graphite or other carbon compounds. During charging, lithium ions are released from the anode, and during discharge, they return to the anode.  
        - Cathode: The cathode is one of the essential components in lithium polymer batteries and is typically made of lithium-containing metal oxides or phosphate materials, similar to the cathode in traditional lithium-ion batteries.  
        - Lithium Salt: The electrolyte of lithium polymer batteries contains lithium salt, which enhances the electrolyte's conductivity.  
        - Electrode Connectors: The internal electrodes of lithium polymer batteries are often made of thin, sheet-like lithium alloy materials, and they are connected to the external circuit of the battery using connectors.

        <td>The main purpose of installing a low voltage alarm is to prevent the battery from reaching a critically low level, thereby avoiding abnormal vehicle operation or potential damage to the battery. Therefore, when the battery voltage drops below a specific threshold, the low voltage alarm will sound, alerting the user to pay attention and replace the battery promptly if necessary.
