## Introduce Lego Differential 介紹樂高差速器
- This differential integrates a 16-tooth gear and a 24-tooth gear, both of which have a circular hole with a 5mm diameter at their centers for accommodating a cross-axis. In the center of the differential, there is a small pillar, which allows us to better secure the right-angle mating gear.

## 選擇原因
- Due to the compact size of this differential, and the fact that the larger 24-tooth gear on the motor is of the same size, it effectively transfers the motor's speed and torque to the tires without causing issues such as reducing torque due to a lower gear ratio or slowing down speed due to a higher gear ratio.
