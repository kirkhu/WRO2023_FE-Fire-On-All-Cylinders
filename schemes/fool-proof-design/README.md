- During the hardware design process, we encountered a few instances where the Raspberry Pi controller or IC was damaged due to incorrect power or data cable connections. To prevent such issues, we implemented a solution using male-female connectors for both power supply and data transmission. This approach ensured correct wiring and effectively mitigated the risk of the Raspberry Pi or IC getting burnt. These design improvements have enhanced the stability of the hardware system, leading to increased overall product reliability and lifespan.  
- During the hardware design process, we initially used a breadboard to connect the circuits. Unfortunately, we encountered some instances of burning or poor contacts, resulting in abnormal functionality or potential issues that were challenging to detect. To improve this situation, we made the decision to switch to soldering the circuits onto a prototyping board. This change significantly reduced the risks of burning or poor contacts while ensuring stable and reliable connections. Through this improvement, we successfully enhanced the overall hardware system's reliability and ensured proper functionality.
