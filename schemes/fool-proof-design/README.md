- In the process of hardware design, there have been several cases of damage to Raspberry Pi controllers or ICs due to incorrect power connections or data cable insertion. To avoid this problem, we adopted a solution of using male and female sockets for power supply and data transmission. Through male and female sockets, the correct wiring is ensured, effectively avoiding the risk of Raspberry Pi or IC burning. This design improvement has increased the stability of the hardware system, improved the overall reliability and service life of the product.  
- In the process of hardware design, we initially used breadboards to connect circuits, but unfortunately encountered some cases of burning or poor contact, which led to abnormal function operation or potential problems that were difficult to find. To improve this situation, we decided to use soldering to fix the circuit on a PCB. This change has significantly reduced the risk of burning or poor contact, while ensuring a stable and reliable connection. Through this improvement, we have successfully improved the overall reliability of the hardware system and ensured the normal operation of the function.
