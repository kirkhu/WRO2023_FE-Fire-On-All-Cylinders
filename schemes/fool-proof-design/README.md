- In the process of hardware design, there have been several cases of damage to Raspberry Pi controllers or ICs due to incorrect power connections or data cable insertion. To avoid this problem, we adopted a solution of using male and female sockets for power supply and data transmission. Through male and female sockets, the correct wiring is ensured, effectively avoiding the risk of Raspberry Pi or IC burning. This design improvement has increased the stability of the hardware system, improved the overall reliability and service life of the product.  
- During the hardware design process, we initially used a breadboard to connect the circuits. Unfortunately, we encountered some instances of burning or poor contacts, resulting in abnormal functionality or potential issues that were challenging to detect. To improve this situation, we made the decision to switch to soldering the circuits onto a prototyping board. This change significantly reduced the risks of burning or poor contacts while ensuring stable and reliable connections. Through this improvement, we successfully enhanced the overall hardware system's reliability and ensured proper functionality.
