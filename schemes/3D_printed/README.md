## 3D Printed

- 3D printing is a manufacturing technology that transforms digital models into physical objects by layering materials one after another to create the object.
- We have chosen to use 3D printing for the fabrication of the car body due to its advantages over using a Laser Cutting Machine to cut wooden panels. 3D printing offers inherent structural integrity, eliminating the need for assembly steps and resulting in a more lightweight design.

## Light Curing

- Photocuring is a process that utilizes ultraviolet (UV) or other visible light to cure specific materials. It is commonly employed in areas such as 3D printing and coatings, where materials undergo a chemical reaction upon exposure to light, transitioning from a liquid or semi-solid state to a solid state.

- In 3D printing, photopolymerization is a prevalent technique known as stereolithography (SLA) or digital light processing (DLP) printing. In this method, liquid resin is selectively applied layer by layer onto a build platform. A UV light source is then used to irradiate the resin, solidifying it layer by layer to gradually construct the desired object's shape. This technology enables the creation of high-precision, intricate structures, with the ability for rapid production.

- Within the photopolymerization process, a photosensitizer is an essential component. A photosensitizer is a substance capable of absorbing light energy and initiating a chemical reaction. It is typically added to the resin. When light shines on the resin, the photosensitizer absorbs the energy, triggering intermolecular cross-linking reactions that transform the liquid into a solid.

- Photocuring technology is widely used in various fields, including product development, medical devices, jewelry, industrial manufacturing, and more. It enables high-precision, rapid, and customizable manufacturing, offering considerable flexibility in different materials and applications.
