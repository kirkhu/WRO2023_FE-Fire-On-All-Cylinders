## Light Curing
- Photocuring is a process that uses ultraviolet (UV) or other visible light sources to cure specific materials. It is commonly used in fields such as 3D printing, coatings, and bonding, where materials undergo a chemical reaction under the exposure of light, transforming from liquid or semi-solid states to solid states.

- In 3D printing, photocuring is a common technique known as UV curing 3D printing. In this method, liquid resin is applied layer by layer on a build platform, and then exposed to UV light sources, causing each layer of resin to cure and gradually build up the shape of the object. This technology is capable of producing objects with high precision and complex structures.

- During the process of photocuring, photosensitizers are essential elements. Photosensitizers are substances that can absorb light energy and trigger chemical reactions. They are usually added to the resin. When light is directed onto the resin, photosensitizers absorb the light energy, initiating cross-linking reactions between molecules and transforming the liquid into a solid state.

- Photocuring technology is widely used in various fields, including product development, medical devices, jewelry, industrial manufacturing, and more. It enables high-precision, rapid, and customizable manufacturing, offering considerable flexibility in different materials and applications.
