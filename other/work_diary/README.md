As the competition is scheduled for this week, we have intensified our practice efforts, trying out various scenarios and adjusting our program to adapt to a wide range of situations. Experimenting with different scenarios has the advantage of helping us anticipate challenges that our machine might face and making necessary adjustments in advance. Here's our practice approach:

- We have assigned lane labels A, B, C, and D. Each lane is divided into three sections, with placement points for blocks both on the inner and outer sides in each section. Red blocks indicating turning conditions will be placed sequentially, while the positions of other blocks will be randomized.
- The record sheet will include the following information:
  1. Completion time
  2. Number of successful attempts/number of failed attempts
We believe that this approach will assist our machine in preparing for a variety of scenarios, ensuring that we are well-prepared for the competition.

Today is our match day. In the first half of the qualifying round, due to our Request for Maintenance during the initial round, the score was reduced by 50%, resulting in our obtaining 15 points. In the second round, we successfully completed it and achieved a full score of 30 points, allowing us to advance to the second half of the obstacle course. During the first obstacle race, our robot hit the wall and stopped due to excessive avoidance; fortunately, after adjustments, the second attempt by our team resulted in a perfect score. This marked a successful conclusion to today's competition.

由於比賽即將在本週舉行，我們已經開始加強練習，嘗試不同的題目並調整程式，以適應大多數的情況。嘗試不同的題目有一個好處，就是可以幫助我們找出機器可能遇到的挑戰，並提前進行必要的調整。以下是我們的練習方式：

- 我們將走道編號為A、B、C、D。每個走道分為三個區域，每個區域都有內外兩個放置方塊的點。指示轉彎條件的紅色方塊會按順序放置，其他方塊則會隨機調整。
- 紀錄表將包括以下信息：
  1. 完成時間
  2. 成功嘗試次數/失敗次數  

我們相信，這種做法將幫助我們的機器準備應對各種不同的情況，確保我們在比賽中做好充分的準備。

今日為我們的比賽日，在上半場的資格賽中，因為第一場在比賽過程中我們有申請維修，因此成績被減少50%，得到15分，第二場我們則順利完成圈數獲得30分滿分，成功晉級下半場障礙賽。在第一場障礙賽時，因為躲避幅度過大而撞牆停止比賽，但幸好在調整過後，第二順利獲得滿分，為今日比賽做了完美的結尾。
