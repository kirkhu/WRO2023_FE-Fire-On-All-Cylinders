- OpenCV（Open Source Computer Vision Library） of Introduction
   OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision library that serves as a powerful tool for processing images and videos in computer vision tasks. It supports various programming languages, including Python, C++, Java, and more, making it accessible across different platforms.

   OpenCV offers a wide range of functionalities and algorithms, encompassing tasks such as image processing, feature detection, object recognition, video analysis, and more. It finds applications in numerous fields, such as machine vision, image processing, video tracking, facial recognition, augmented reality, and others.

   The first step to using OpenCV typically involves installing the OpenCV library and then utilizing the relevant APIs for image or video processing tasks. This may involve reading image or video files, applying various image processing techniques (such as filtering, edge detection, color conversion, etc.), or performing object recognition and tracking tasks.
- This competition will utilize OpenCV for color block (red, green) recognition, and will adopt version 4.5.3.
```
$ Pip3 install opencv-python==4.5.3.56     
$ sudo apt-get install python-opencv
```
