- Jetson Nano is a small single-board computer developed by NVIDIA, widely acclaimed for its high computational performance, high customizability, and open-source nature.
- The hardware configuration of Jetson Nano includes a processor, memory, 4 USB ports, HDMI output, GPIO pins, and more.
- It is suitable for various applications such as programming education in the field of education, smart home devices, autonomous vehicles, DIY projects, and more. This compact yet powerful microcomputer has become the preferred choice for electronics enthusiasts, students, and professionals alike.

Due to the need for high budget efficiency in image recognition and to enhance the vehicle's movement speed, a high-speed data processing and computational capability is necessary

__Therefore, we have chosen NVIDIA Jetson Nano as the hardware development platform for the self-driving vehicle.__

 - Jetson Nano是由NVIDIA開發的一款小型單板電腦，因其高計算性能、高可定制性和開放源碼特性而聞名。
- Jetson Nano的硬件配置包括處理器、內存、4個USB端口、HDMI輸出、GPIO引腳等。
- 它適用於各種應用，如教育領域的編程教育、智能家居設備、自動駕駛車輛、DIY項目等。這款小巧而功能強大的微型電腦已成為電子愛好者、學生和專業人士的首選。
 
由於影像辨識需要高預算效率，為了提升車輛移動速度，高速的訊息處理及運算能力是必要的。
__因此，我們選擇Jetson Nano作為我們的核心控制器__
