## Vehicle Introduction

We use 3mm planks which were cut by the laser beam cutting machine as the chassis of our vehicle and design the turning section along with LEGO blocks with the intention of shrinking the dimension and stabilizing it. On top of that, considering that the Raspberry Pi 4 isn't only quick in operating but is suitable for image identifying, we chose it as the main controller of our vehicle.

## Introduces of Electromechanical Components

GA25-371 Dc Gear Motor：Drives the rear wheels of the vehicle in order to control it move forward and backward.  

MG90S-Metal Gear Micro Servo Motor：Force the mechanical structure to let the vehicle turn.  

Lithium Polymer：Provides electricities for the Raspberry and other electromechanical components.  

L293D Motor Driver: Controls GA25-371 Dc Gear Motor to turn clockwise, conterclockwise, and alter the direction of it.  

ADIO-DC36V5A Switching Power Adapter：Stable the electricity that the lithium polymer provides  

jmdo.96c OLED display：To show some specific numerical data of the Raspberry.  

Tcs34725 RGB Color Sensor：To dectect lines and calculate the laps the vehicle had passed.   

Raspberry pi Camera (G)：Images collecting and identifying.  

Arduino Ultrasonic Sensor : Calculate the length between the wall and the vehicle.  

Raspberry Pi 4：In charge of all the models of vehicle controllers. 

# Vehicle Structure Introduction
## Differential

In order to solve the problem that the path taken by the outer wheels is larger than the path taken by the inner wheels when turning, we install a differential.

## The Steering Mechanism

In order to have better steering, we design the steering rudder as Ackerman steering structure, and use the servo motor to control the steering of the steering rudder.
