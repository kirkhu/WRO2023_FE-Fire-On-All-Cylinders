### Introduction to Fritzing
- Fritzing is a convenient and user-friendly tool that can be used to draw circuit diagrams for self-driving cars, and it does not require any software installation. Fritzing provides a variety of electronic components and modules, which users can simply drag and drop onto the canvas to quickly create and design their circuit diagrams. This makes it particularly suitable for beginners or those unfamiliar with complex circuit design software.
- In addition to circuit diagrams, Fritzing also allows users to create schematics, breadboard views, and even design custom PCB (Printed Circuit Board) layouts. This comprehensive feature set makes it a valuable tool for prototyping and educational purposes. 
- After drawing the circuit diagram using Fritzing, it becomes convenient to solder the circuit on a breadboard following the diagram. This reduces the error rate and allows for easy corrections.

- The circuit diagrams created for this competition are all designed using Fritzing.
