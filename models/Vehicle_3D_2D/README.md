### Introduction to Onshape
- Using  Onshape to design a 3D model of a self-driving car. Onshape is a free and user-friendly web-based design software.
- After creating the model using Onshape, you can generate 2D flat dimension drawings and then proceed to cut it with a laser cutting machine.
- The 3D/2D models created for this competition are all designed using Onshape.
